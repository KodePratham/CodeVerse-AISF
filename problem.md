Problem Statement 12: Repetitive Multi-Sheet Consolidation & Sharing: Daily
reporting involved manually combining multiple sheets into a single workbook and
distributing it to stakeholders, which was repetitive, error-prone, and delayed.

solution : 

Your app solves two things at once:

Merging Sheets (Automation)

Users upload their files (Excel, CSV, etc.).

The system automatically consolidates them into one master report.

No need for manual copy-pasting or formatting.

Sharing Reports (Distribution)

The final consolidated report can be instantly shared/downloaded/emailed to stakeholders.

This removes the bottleneck of one person manually distributing.
